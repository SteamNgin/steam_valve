# SteamValve

Steam Valve is a gem for wrapping up interactions with the Steam Web API into ruby objects. Created for use with our 
Steam Ngin app, we have extracted the functionality into its own gem for all to use.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'steam_valve'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install steam_valve

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
